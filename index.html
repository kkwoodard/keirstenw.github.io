                Netflix.com </a>is a lifesaver when you just want to escape life and check out for a while. I guess you could say its an addictive drug for the soul. hehehe. Netflix supports my decisions to binge watch any show I'd like.
                <li>I also like YouTube.

                <br>There, I can watch so many creative youtubers and watch basically anything I want. I love seeing youtubers securing their bags without having to try super hard.
